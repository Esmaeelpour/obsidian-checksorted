# DoneZone

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that moves completed to-do items into a dedicated **Done Zone** section at the bottom of your note; keeping your active tasks clean and your completed ones archived in place.

## Features

- **Move completed items** — sends all checked `- [x]` tasks to the completed area
- **Auto-return** — unchecking an item in the completed area sends it back automatically
- **Restore items** — uncheck and return all completed items at once via command
- **Clear completed area** — permanently removes all completed items and the section header
- **Auto-move** — optionally move items the moment they are checked
- **Status bar toggle** — shows auto-move state (`✓` / `✗`) and toggles it on click
- **Date stamping** — appends a completion date (e.g. `✅ 2026-06-19`) when items are moved
- **Sort order** — append new items to the bottom or prepend to the top of the completed area
- **Configurable header** — set the heading level (H1–H6) and name of the completed section
- **Ribbon icon** — one-click full sync from the left sidebar: returns unchecked items out of the completed area, then moves newly completed ones into it (can be hidden)

## Usage

### Commands

All commands are available via the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`):

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| **Move completed items to completed area** | Moves all `- [x]` items from your note body into the completed section |
| **Restore all items from completed area** | Unchecks all items and moves them back to the note body |
| **Clear completed area** | Deletes the completed section and all items in it |

You can assign custom hotkeys to any of these in **Settings → Hotkeys**.

### Ribbon icon

Clicking the DoneZone ribbon icon in the left sidebar runs a **full sync** in one step:

1. Any unchecked `- [ ]` items left in the completed area are returned to the main list (and stray empty checkboxes are cleared).
2. All checked `- [x]` items in the note body are moved into the completed area.

### Example

Before running Move:

```markdown
- [ ] Write proposal
- [x] Research topic
- [ ] Schedule meeting
- [x] Review notes
```

After running Move:

```markdown
- [ ] Write proposal
- [ ] Schedule meeting

## Completed
- [x] Research topic
- [x] Review notes
```

Unchecking an item in the completed area automatically returns it to the main list.
